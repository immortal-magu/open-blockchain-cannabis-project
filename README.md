# Open Cannabis Project
<b>Cannabis is in danger of going the way the rest of agriculture has gone: toward monoculture, centralization, and restrictive patenting.</b>

The Open Cannabis Project (OCP) was established [by industry leaders](https://opencannabisproject.org/team/) to resist these forces and to protect the genetic diversity of the Cannabis plant as well as the economic diversity of the cannabis industry.

# The Problem
The [US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)](https://www.uspto.gov/) has started granting patents on cannabis varieties. Agricultural patents are generally bad for the environment, for farmers, and for the future of crop plants themselves.

For cannabis, they’re a disaster. The first cannabis patents issued by the USPTO are the kind of overly broad patent protection that kills innovation instead of incentivizing it. They’re called <b>utility patents</b>, and they don’t cover single varieties: they cover huge categories of cannabis. Which means that just a handful of such patents could potentially lock up all of cannabis.

# What We Can Do
The USPTO can’t legally grant patents that would cover existing varieties – but there has to be proof that they exist. We can block this process by providing this proof: documenting genetic and chemovar data for all of the cannabis varieties in existence today.

As collective <b>evidence of prior art</b>, [the OCP database](https://opencannabisproject.org/ocp-database/) and [our curation of public cannabis documentation](https://opencannabisproject.org/external-data-resources/) will help keep cannabis varieties where they belong: in the public domain, free for anyone to breed and grow.

# How This Already Epic Project Could be Better 

This project will save future generations from the money hungry corporate entities of the agricultural and pharmaceutical industry. Drastic steps need to be taken by the community while there is time.

1) Magu proposes that all the data found in [the OCP database](https://opencannabisproject.org/ocp-database/) be stored on a distributed ledger in order to double down on the safety of this utmost important data, transforming the project into, The Open Blockchain Cannabis Project (OBCP).

2) Magu would love to see whats going on under the hood. Consolidation of the data from all genome contributors with an interactive graphical view of the blockchain could shine light on the project. This would make it engaging. It may help in spreading the importance of this crucial project and accelerate contribtion from all that believe in the healing power of the plant of all plants.
